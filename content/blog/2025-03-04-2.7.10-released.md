Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.10** with many bug fixes and enhancements. The most prominent changes are the addition of a Proton Pass importer and (due to popular request) a new setting for changing the application font size. Other additions in this release are nicer icons in the password strength column, a character count in the password generator, toolbar buttons for quick access to database settings and statistics, a new MIXED case preset for the passphrase generator, and a command-line flag to start KeePassXC in minimised mode.
