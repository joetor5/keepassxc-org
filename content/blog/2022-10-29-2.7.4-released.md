Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.4**, the fourth maintenance update for the 2.7 stable series.

The release fixes several issues that appeared in the previous release concerning the browser integration and the
entry preview panel, as well as a compatibility problem with macOS 13 Ventura. In addition, we also improved
Unicode support on Windows and added a two-month password expiration preset.
