Today, we are releasing **KeePassXC 2.7.8** with many bug fixes and enhancements, particularly to our passkey support. We also fixed several crashes
that were discovered in the previous release. Finally, this version introduces several quality of life improvements that were ported over from the 
development branch that we think you will enjoy. Let's dive in!

## Passkey Improvements

Passkeys are still a fledgling technology, as of this writing, and we are trying to keep pace with the rapid adoption across various websites, in 
addition to specification refinements. The following is a short list of critical improvements to our passkeys support:

* Update an existing passkey or add one to an existing entry
* Support more specification standards
* Various UI improvements to dialogs and context menus
* Show a warning prior to exporting a passkey

## Quality of Life Improvements

In addition to bug fixes, we always strive to deliver something useful in each of our updates. For 2.7.8, we have brought forward several awesome features including:

* A database setting to allow a delay prior to auto-save
* Improvements to Bitwarden and 1Password importers
* Improvements to monospace font display
* Improve display of dialog buttons on Linux
* SSH Agent: don't auto-load keys that are in the recycle bin
